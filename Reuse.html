            Another way to reduce our carbon footprint is to reuse items that otherwise would end up in landfills. 
            While most people know about the heavy impact of electricity production, beef, cars and planes, 
            emissions from landfills are an equally important contributor to the world's carbon emissions.
            <a style="color: green" href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#sector-by-sector-where-do-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from">
            The emissions leaking out of the production and discarding of goods that end up in landfills 
            landfills are as significant as the emissions of all the jets in the air.

              <h2  style="font-family: Optima">Idea I: Reusing Plastic Items</h2>
              <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                Plastic goods are a high source of pollution and account for much of today's landfill waste.
                As plastics are made from fossil fuels such as petroleum, converting raw materials into plastic through
                its heavily industrialized production process emits carbon emissions comparable to that caused by burning fossil fuels to produce
                electricity, ultimately accounting for 10-20% of the world's carbon emissions.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                Fortunately, we can keep plastic out of landfills and reduce the amount of plastic produced
                by reusing materials past their due in a multitude of ways.
                For example, empty plastic water bottles can be reused to create little flower pots or DIY bird feeders or or can simply be
                refilled with more water, and plastic bags can
                be reused as miniature mutli-purpose bags. Additionally, we can replace disposable plastic bottles and bags
                altogether by using durable reusable water bottles and cloth bags instead, reducing the amount of 
                plastics manufactured and eventually thrown away. When a plastic contraption seems to be reusable no more,
                an amazing way to send it off is to recycle!
                Reusing and recycling plastic goods as a community rather than simply throwing
                them away can help reduce carbon emissions, keeping the Earth clean and healthy
                for generations to come!

                <h2  style="font-family: Optima">Idea II: Reusing Paper</h2>
                <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                Paper is also a commonly used material, be it for school, work, or for fun at home!
                However, paper is also usually thrown away after 
                one or two uses, quickly piling up in landfills and leeching into nearby habitats. 
                Moreover, simply using paper means that trees are being killed
                for our convenience, and as trees are major players in intaking excess carbon dioxide
                for their photosynthetic processes, the very production of paper drastically increases
                our carbon footprint. In order to minimize the amount of trees being cut down, as to do so
                would both rob tree-dwelling animals of their homes and directly increase atmospheric carbon content,
                we must treat paper with far more significance than a one-time tool to be written on
                and then immediately thrown away; we must instead treat paper as a valuable and reusable good. There are multiple 
                ways to reuse paper: we could use both sides of a given piece of paper before discarding, we can write notes on
                all of the page to minimize whitespace and subsequent paper wastage, and we can reuse it to make DIY creations
                and packaging materials. Of course, all good things must come to an end, so after it seems as though
                a slip of paper can be useful no longer, instead of simply throwing it in the trash, we should recycle it 
                so that the paper can be once again reused to make a whole new product, reducing waste in landfills and 
                preserving the world's trees that would otherwise be cut down.

              <p>
                We can reduce carbon emissions by reusing materials that may otherwise pollute the Earth in 
                landfills or through the very process of producing said materials.
                Reusing plastic items such as bottles and bags, replacing disposable plastic items with durable
                reusable ones such as multi-use bottles and cloth bags, reusing paper by using both sides and repurposing
                it into DIY creations and packaging materials, and recycling <a style="color:green" href="https://greenblue.org/top-18-things-you-should-not-recycle-curbside/">applicable items</a>
                are all things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint.
