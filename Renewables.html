    <title>Reducing Our Carbon Footprint - Renewables</title>

        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            Finally, we can reduce our Carbon Footprint as a community by using renewable resources and alternate energy saving techniques. 
            Using renewable resources is important because they sustain the Earth's ability to provide for future generations and generally 
            are not major sources of polluting carbon emissions. Below will be some ideas for implementing renewable resources in our community.
        </p>

            <div class="col-md-7" id="main-content">
              <h2  style="font-family: Optima">Idea I: Using PaveGen</h2>
              <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                PaveGen is a technology that converts the kinetic energy of walking pedestrians into electricity. 
                This is done by building in special pads into sidewalks which absorb kinetic energy. If implemented, 
                this techology has to potential be a viable renewable energy source, as for the time being millions of 
                people walk on the streets, be it for leisure, a quick trip to a friend's house, etc, and walking will 
                continue to be a thing until life ceases to exist.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                Producing about 3 joules of energy per footstep with a limit of up to 5 watts per walker, 
                PaveGen's immediate applications can be to power environmental sensors, batteries, and more! 
                Currently deployed in London, Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, and Thailand, PaveGen is reducing 
                carbon emissions by providing energy without burning fossil fuels!
                We may not have the direct control necessary to implement this idea in our community now, it is a sign of hope
                to look forward to in the future.

                  <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    Another renewable resource we can all make use of is the sun. While installing solar panels can be expensive, 
                   areas with consistent sunlight for extended periods of time such as the southern USA are able to produce around
                   15,000 kilowatts of energy per year. Since the average suburban home runs on around 10,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually,
                   sufficient input from solar panels can lead to homes being able to be powered entirely by solar! Whenever you're looking to renovate
                   your home and spruce it up, look beyond the deals for rugs and sofas and think solar, since solar panels lead to both a 
                   futuristic roof and a green Earth!

                  <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                   There are two main size groups of solar panels:
                    60-cell panels that output 270-300 watts and 72-cell panels which output 350-400 watts.
                    60-cell panels are generally used for homes whereas as 72-cell panels are used for larger
                    buildings and commerical solar projects due to their extra row of cells and higher
                    energy output. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    A high quality solar panel with an output rating of around 290 watts, if met with around 5 hours of direct sunlight, 
                    can produce 500-550 kilowatt hours of energy annually. A system of these solar panels, which would total around 30 panels
                    with an 8,700 watt (8.7 kilowatt) solar panel system would provide 43.5 kilowatt hours of electricity daily,
                    around 15,800 kilowatt hours annually, providing more than enough energy to power an average home using 10,600
                    kWh of electricity fully on solar!

                  <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    Residential turbines are another great way to produce renewable energy. 
                    In windy states such as Texas, one wind turbine can generate 10 kilowatts of energy
                    hourly. This multiplied by 24 hours per day and 356 days per year
                    works out to an annual output of 87,600 kW. However, the effectiveness
                    of residential wind turbines depends on how windy its place of installation
                    is, for where there is a lot of wind 87,600 kilowatts is a feasable output whereas 
                    where there are only occasional breezes only a handfull of watts can be produced.
                    However, residential wind turbines still represent a possible alternative to 
                    fossil fuels, as it can still be used to supplement energy gained from other renewable energy sources such as
                    solar panels and hydroelectric plants.

                <p>
                  We can reduce carbon emissions by using alternative and renewable energy sources that
                  can provide us with energy for generations to come while not polluting the environment.
                  Looking into the applications of technologies such as PaveGen, installing solar panels
                  on our roofs, and investing in residential wind turbines
                  are all things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint.

                Installing residential wind turbines in our community

                At maximum speed, one residential wind turbine can generate 
                10kw of electricity per hour. So for 24 hours a day and 365 days 
                in a year, this calculates to 87,6000 kW of electricity per year 
                from one wind turbine.  This is enough to power 8 homesâ€™ yearly 
                electricity usage.
