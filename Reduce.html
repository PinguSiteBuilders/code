            First of all, we can reduce the activities that we do as a community that pollute the Earth. </p>

                <h2 style="font-family: Optima;">Idea I: Reducing Waste</h2>
                <p>We can do this by changing 
                  our lifestyle to create as little waste as possible, reducing plastic usage - which can 
                  take a thousand years to decompose - and food waste. Food and plastic are the most widely 
                  consumed goods that produce considerable amounts of carbon emissions and to put those to waste 
                  not only undermines their purpose but makes them even more wasteful. Thus, by simply using less 
                  plastic bags, reusing them, or replacing them altogether with durable cloth ones, we can reduce
                  and by composting leftover food in home gardens or depositing it in <a style="color: green" href="https://www.litterless.com/where-to-compost/texas">compost drop-off areas</a>
                  that might otherwise simply end up in landfills,
                  we can actively reduce our carbon footprint and sustain the Earth for generations to come.
                  Composting can also help reduce carbon emissions as the organic matter of leftover food 
                  can be reused by the soil to generate nutrients for other plants/crops to grow on it, reducing the need for
                  artifical fertlizers, which can pollute the Earth through overenriching the soil and by running off into nearby water-supplies.
                  . This also limits the waste brought into landfills, which take up a lot of space and 
                  disrupts nearby ecosystems, in addition to causing carbon emissions when they are disintigrated in plants.</p>

                  <h2 style="font-family: Optima;">Idea II: Alternative Transportation</h2>
                  <p>
                    In addition, we can reduce our carbon footprint if we adopt alternative modes
                    of transportation. 29% of our carbon 
                    emission is caused by the usage of transportation, and carbon emissions from transportation
                    will only increase as our population grows and consquently uses more cars and other polluting vehicles., 
                    Ways we can start to reduce our carbon footprint is by using transportation options 
                    other than the traditional gasoline-powered car, such as biking or walking to nearby destinations. 
                    Relying on public transportation such as buses also helps to reduce carbon emissions as 
                    it replaces a street full of personal vehicles with one big vehicle that can hold many people.

                    <h2 style="font-family: Optima ;">Idea III: Saving Electricity</h2>
                    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    We can also reduce our carbon footrprint by simply saving electricity. 
                    According to the EPA, electricity accounted 
                    for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. The production of electricity 
                    involves the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas, 
                    releasing greenhouse gas into the air. Thus, less energy used by users, the less amount of fuel 
                    is needed to generate electricity, resulting in a decrease in greenhouse gasses emitted. 
                    We can do this by turning off lights when we leave rooms, setting the thermostat a few degrees higher
                    in the summer and lower in the winter, and by switching to LED lights as they are more 
                    conservative of energy compared to the typical fluorescent ones found in buildings.
                    Moreover, there are also ways to produce energy without excessively releasing carbon dioxide
                    by using renewable and non-polluting resources. The use of solar panels, 
                    geothermal energy, and windmills/turbines are alternate ways to produce electricity 
                    rather than burning fossil fuels in power plants.

                    <h2 style="font-family: Optima;">Idea IV: Reducing Meat Consumption</h2>
                    <p>
                      Lastly, we can reduce our consumption of meat. 
                      Why reduce eating meat? Meat produces a lot of carbon emissions 
                      compared to plants, especially in the animalâ€™s growth stage before 
                      slaughter. First of all, meat requires an animal, which breathes and 
                      secretes out carbon everywhere, to be raised to a certain standard 
                      that is then slaughtered. While plant crops also produce decent amounts of carbon 
                      emissions throughout their cycle, their carbon emissions are extremely 
                      miniscule compared to meat production as they primarily intake carbon dioxide
                      for photosynthesis, whereas livestock exhale carbon dioxide and secrete chemicals such 
                      as methane through their burps and other bodily processes.

                      Simply reducing the amount of meat consumption in as a community 
                      would remove carbon emissions drastically.

                        <p>
                          We can reduce carbon emissions by reducing activities that cause them.
                          Adopting alternative transportation such as buses and bicycles, saving electricity
                          by turning off lights when leaving rooms,
                          and reducing meat consumption are all things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint.
